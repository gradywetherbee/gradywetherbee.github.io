		<p> Working in the San Francisco East Bay, Friends of Five creeks educates, organizes, and empowers environmentally-conscious 
		citizens by offering guided walks, coordinating volunteering events, and making environmental education accessible. <br> <br>
		Simplicity is in crucial designing an effective bookmark, so the actual content was broken down into three
		steps that could be easily remembered, followed by instructions on how to carry them out.  By making ecological stewardship simple, understandable, 
		and executable, the audience becomes more likely to contribute the movement's goal: protecting East Bay watersheds.  <br> <br>
		The design process, even for something as small as this bookmark, involved many iterations.  The conceptualization of this bookmark started as 
		a simple list with filler text and images, but evolved to become shorter and cleaner, as the total number of items was decreased in favor of 
		simplicity and potential for retention.  Finally the design was forked into two final versions - a light blue version to catch the eye of readers
		under the age of 25, and a high-contrast version for an older audience.</p> </div>
